## Deep Learning Models of the Retinal Response to Natural Scenes
Deep retina is a project to test to what degree artificial neural networks can predict retinal ganglion cell responses to natural stimuli.

Please see our [NIPS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01825) for more details.

Note that deepretina requires python 3.5 or higher.

### Usage
To install the dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Scripts for training models are located in the `scripts` folder (e.g. see `scripts/fit_models.py`). Model definitions are in `deepretina/models.py`
